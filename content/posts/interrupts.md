# Interrupt Handling
This guide is for setting up Interrupts on a i686 operating system.
If you are curious about starting your own operating system or how I got here,
check out [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org) they have tons of tutorials on how to setup your own

I followed the bare bones tutorial specifically, [bare bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones). It details setting up your own kernel.
If you want more information on how I got started on my operating system I will make a tutorial soon

Without further ado, here's my tutorial.
